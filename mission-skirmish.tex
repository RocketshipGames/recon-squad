\missiontitle{Recon Squad Mission: Skirmish}

\begin{columns}

  \emph{This is a good default, symmetric mission to play for your
    first games of Recon Squad or in pick-up play.  Other missions can
    be easily made on your own, or are available at
    \url{http://rocketshipgames.com/} in our other unofficial 40k
    campaigns \& supplements.}
  
\missionheading{Summary}%

Outriders patrolling the outskirts of their main forces have crashed
into each other---contact is made!  No quarter is given as the hot
flames of war leap to life.  Neither side can afford to lose this
ground and leave their army vulnerable to a flanking attack.

%\smallskip {\bf Campaign Play:} Attacker and Defender roles are
%identical in this mission and have no effect in-game.

\missionheading{The Battlefield}%

The mission is played on a~4'x4' table.  A variety of ruins, woods,
and other terrain should cover a quarter to a half of the board,
roughly symmetrically.

Deployment zones are diagonal table corners, up to~12'' from the
centerline between them.  Roll off to determine who chooses a corner
and their player table edge, the other player taking the opposite.

Objective markers are placed at the center of the table and the
centers of the two table quadrants opposite the deployment zone
corners.

\missionheading{Mission Rules}%

Roll off to determine who decides which player deploys first.  After
both players deploy, the player that setup first chooses to play first
or second.  The player to go second may attempt to Seize the
Initiative.

Night Fighting is in effect for Turn~1 on a~D6 of~4+; on a~1 or~2 it
takes effect on Turn~5 and thereafter.

The Variable Game Length rule applies.  At game end use the scoring
chart to determine the victor!
